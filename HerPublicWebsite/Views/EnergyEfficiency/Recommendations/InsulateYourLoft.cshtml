        Based on the information we have collected; it looks like you have no insulation in your loft. 
        We recommend that you have your loft insulated, if possible, 
        up to the recommended thickness of 300mm, or 12 inches.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
        Adding insulation will help trap the heat inside your property so your heating doesn’t need to be on as much, 
        and so could make a significant saving on your fuel bills.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-inset-text">
        If some of your loft is boarded so that you can store things up there you will either need to raise this 
        boarding up and insulate underneath it or leave that part of the loft without insulation.
    </p>

            You have a pitched (sloping) roof with an unheated loft space that someone could easily get into.

        <li>
            Your loft has no insulation
        </li>
        <li>
            If your loft is insulated, but you have less than the recommended amount (300mm or 12 inches thick) then
            it could still be worthwhile topping up your insulation
