        Based on the information we have collected; it looks like you have some insulation in your loft but it’s less
        than the recommended amount. It could be worthwhile adding some more
        to bring it up to the recommended thickness of 300mm, or 12 inches.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
        Adding extra insulation can help trap the heat inside your property so your
        heating doesn’t need to be on as much.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-inset-text">
        If some of your loft is boarded so that you can store things up there
        you will either need to raise this boarding up and insulate underneath
        it, or leave that part of the loft with thinner insulation.
